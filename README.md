DROPSHIP: Orcs in Space
====================
[a Ludum Dare 41 game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/dropship-orcs-in-space)

Play the compo (48-hour timelimit) game [here](https://benhhopkins.itch.io/dropship).

I might continue to update this repo to make the game I didn't have time to make in one weekend.

Based off of the [Brunch with Phaser 3](https://github.com/samme/brunch-phaser) example.
